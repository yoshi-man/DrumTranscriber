```
pip install librosa tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn streamlit streamlit-player
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```Python
from DrumTranscriber import DrumTranscriber
import librosa

samples, sr = librosa.load(PATH/TO/AUDIO/CLIP)

transcriber = DrumTranscriber()

# pandas dataframe containing probabilities of classes
predictions = transcriber.predict(samples, sr)
```

### For Streamlit

cd to the parent directory and run the following command:
```
streamlit run frontend.py
```
A localhost website will appear with the demo app.


## Getting Started

1. Clone/Zip the directory
2. Redownload the model .h5 file from `/model/drum_transcriber.h5` (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w2fIHeyr-st3sbk1PYrtGOYW6YAD1fsi/view?usp=sharing)

**Note**: There is an issue with Github zipping the .h5 model file. To properly get the model to work, I suggest downloading the model file from the Google Drive above and directly to replace the model from the clone/zipped folder.
